  description: Python (version 3.9.x) is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level
    programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures,
    combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for
    Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language
    to connect existing components together.
